# Vrinda sales Annual Report on Excel 

Vrinda Sales Annual report 2022 on excel

I created a project on Microsoft Excel with a dataset of Vrinda sales and I sorted the data and performed several functions for representing that data so that the company can grow in the future.


Firstly I organised the data and removed all the duplicate value from the data.(DATA CLEANING)


Then next step was DATA PREPROCESSING in which I made 2 groups as AGE GROUP and MONTH with the formula IF()-AGE GROUP, TEXT()-MONTH.
3rd step was DATA ANALYSIS whichh includes making pivot tables for each criteria required for analysis.


Atlast I made a Annual report for the company.
